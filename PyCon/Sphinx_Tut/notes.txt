Hello there!

I hope you're getting excited for the tutorial on Saturday. I just wanted to reach out to everyone, so you know what to expect.

You can see a full copy of the tutorial and the expected plans on the website here: http://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io I tried to break things up into 30-minute chunks so that we can make sure we're all on the same page every so often. I've done this before and it seems to work well.

If you want to be prepared, you can make sure that you have Sphinx installed (``pip install Sphinx``). I'll also have a USB drive with requirements if you need them and the internet isn't working.

If you're new to Python or Sphinx, it might also help to work through the "set up" steps beforehand (http://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/start/). There is time allotted during the tutorial to do this, so don't feel like you have to do it up front, as you might be bored during that part!

Another good pre-planning resource if you want something to look at is to read through the RST syntax in the Sphinx documentation: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html -- again, we'll be covering a good subset of this in the tutorial, but it doesn't hurt to get started early!

Looking forward to meeting all of you on Saturday.

Cheers,
Eric
